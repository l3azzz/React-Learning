// react is a tool for building UI  component
// intitial release to the public (v0.30) was in july 2013

// brief summary of react

// when liking a post on facebook. instead of refreshing
// the whole page and changing the like color, it only
// changes the thing which need to be, instead of
// completely refreshing the page

// without this the DOM has to be constantly updated
// which uses so much ram and more resources

// it is mainly used for UI DESIGINING

// How does React Work?

// React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
//
// Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in
// memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in
// the browser DOM.
//
// React only changes what needs to be changed!
